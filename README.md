### The Authors

Hi, we are Felix and Max. We started this project during our second semester in informatics
at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://kit.edu). Many discussions and researches gave us first insights into
lexer and parser architectures. Many changes and improvements led to the fact that we were able to release the already
second version of the Truth Table Generator already after the end of the second semester.
All in all, it was a fun project that kept us entertained besides the daily university routine and the exam period.
Cheers!
